With the vast amount of content on YouTube, it can be challenging for businesses to effectively reach and engage with their target audience by using the right influencer to promote their motive/ business. This work aims to provide businesses with valuable insights into the popularity of videos on YouTube and how they can improve their YouTube strategy to effectively reach and engage with their target audience.
The proposed solution is to develop a model that can effectively predict the likelihood of a YouTube video becoming trending based on various data points such as video titles, views, likes, and comments. This helps the business and content creators with valuable insights into how they can use YouTube as a social media platform to reach and engage with their target audience. We will use the insights gained from the social media analytical tools such as YouTube Analytics and Vaizle to make predictions of whether a YouTube video is likely to be trending or not which can be used further to make recommendations for how businesses/ advertisers and content creators can improve their YouTube strategy.
